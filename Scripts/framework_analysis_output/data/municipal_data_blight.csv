SEMI-TRUCK, DUMP TRUCK, ETC.) PARKED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR RESIDENTS AND IS MORE THAN JUST A NUISANCE. HERE’S WHY:  1. SAFETY FIRST: SEMI-TRUCKS/DUMP TRUCKS ARE MASSIVE, OFTEN WEIGHING UP TO 80,000 POUNDS WHEN FULLY LOADED. THAT MAKES THEM A POTENTIAL HAZARD IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE KIDS PLAY, CYCLISTS RIDE, AND CARS TRAVEL. A PARKED SEMI OR DUMP TRUCK CAN BLOCK VISIBILITY, NARROW STREETS, OR EVEN OBSTRUCT EMERGENCY VEHICLES.  2. NOISE POLLUTION: TRUCKS ARE LOUD FOR MANY REASONS. THE ENGINES, ESPECIALLY THOSE USING DIESEL, MAKE A TON OF NOISE FROM BURNING FUEL AND THE EXHAUST SYSTEM. BIG TIRES ROLLING ON THE ROAD ALSO CREATE NOISE, WHICH GETS LOUDER AS THE TRUCK GOES FASTER OR TIRES WEAR DOWN. THE WAY TRUCKS ARE DESIGNED TO CUT THROUGH THE AIR, EVEN THOUGH IT SAVES FUEL, CAN ALSO MAKE THEM NOISY AT HIGH SPEEDS. PLUS, OTHER PARTS LIKE BRAKES, SUSPENSION, AND TRANSMISSION ADD TO THE NOISE ISSUE.  3. TRAFFIC FLOW PROBLEMS: A SEMI-TRUCK OR DUMP TRUCK TAKES UP WAY MORE SPACE THAN A CAR. PARK ONE IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND SUDDENLY DRIVEWAYS ARE BLOCKED, SIDEWALKS ARE INACCESSIBLE, OR ENTIRE LANES OF TRAFFIC CEASE MOVING.  4. AESTHETICS MATTER: MANY NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE A CERTAIN CHARM OR CHARACTER, AND A COMMERCIAL VEHICLE LIKE A SEMI-TRUCK OR DUMP TRUCK DOESN’T ALWAYS FIT THE VIBE.  5. ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS: DIESEL EMISSIONS FROM IDLING TRUCKS CONTRIBUTE TO AIR POLLUTION, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS LIKE THROUGHOUT BATON ROUGE, LA.

VACANT LOT LOCATION: - ADDRESS:  1059 N 35TH ST, BATON ROUGE, LA 70802   -- CORNER OF N 35TH ST AND ZION ST - PARCEL ID: 250074 - SUBDIVISION: EDEN PARK - LOT: 23 - BLOCK: 5  ISSUES: - OWNER LEFT MULTIPLE COMMERCIAL VEHICLES (SEMI TRUCKS) ON VACANT LOT VIOLATING LOUISIANA ORDINANCE - THE PRESENCE OF A COMMERCIAL VEHICLES (E.G. SEMI-TRUCK, DUMP TRUCK, ETC.) PARKED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA CAN CAUSE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR RESIDENTS AND IS MORE THAN JUST A NUISANCE. HERE’S WHY:  1. SAFETY FIRST: SEMI-TRUCKS/DUMP TRUCKS ARE MASSIVE, OFTEN WEIGHING UP TO 80,000 POUNDS WHEN FULLY LOADED. THAT MAKES THEM A POTENTIAL HAZARD IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE KIDS PLAY, CYCLISTS RIDE, AND CARS TRAVEL. A PARKED SEMI OR DUMP TRUCK CAN BLOCK VISIBILITY, NARROW STREETS, OR EVEN OBSTRUCT EMERGENCY VEHICLES.  2. NOISE POLLUTION: TRUCKS ARE LOUD FOR MANY REASONS. THE ENGINES, ESPECIALLY THOSE USING DIESEL, MAKE A TON OF NOISE FROM BURNING FUEL AND THE EXHAUST SYSTEM. BIG TIRES ROLLING ON THE ROAD ALSO CREATE NOISE, WHICH GETS LOUDER AS THE TRUCK GOES FASTER OR TIRES WEAR DOWN. THE WAY TRUCKS ARE DESIGNED TO CUT THROUGH THE AIR, EVEN THOUGH IT SAVES FUEL, CAN ALSO MAKE THEM NOISY AT HIGH SPEEDS. PLUS, OTHER PARTS LIKE BRAKES, SUSPENSION, AND TRANSMISSION ADD TO THE NOISE ISSUE.  3. TRAFFIC FLOW PROBLEMS: A SEMI-TRUCK OR DUMP TRUCK TAKES UP WAY MORE SPACE THAN A CAR. PARK ONE IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND SUDDENLY DRIVEWAYS ARE BLOCKED, SIDEWALKS ARE INACCESSIBLE, OR ENTIRE LANES OF TRAFFIC CEASE MOVING.  4. AESTHETICS MATTER: MANY NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE A CERTAIN CHARM OR CHARACTER, AND A COMMERCIAL VEHICLE LIKE A SEMI-TRUCK OR DUMP TRUCK DOESN’T ALWAYS FIT THE VIBE.   5. ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS: DIESEL EMISSIONS FROM IDLING TRUCKS CONTRIBUTE TO AIR POLLUTION, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC IN DENSELY POPULATED AREAS LIKE THROUGHOUT BATON ROUGE, LA.

MY PROPERTY AND NEIGHBORING PROPERTIES ARE EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN RODENT ACTIVITY STEMMING FROM THIS PROPERTY, PARTICULARLY RATS AND MICE.  CAN THIS PROPERTY BE INSPECTED AND TREATED?   2.	THE PROPERTY IS BLIGHTED AND OVERGROWN WITH WEEDS AND DEAD/ UNMAINTAINED TREES.  TWO OF THESE TREES FELL ON A NEIGHBOR’S TREE AND THEY ALL FELL ON MY PROPERTY AND CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE A WEEK AND A HALF AGO.  THERE ARE MANY TREES ON THIS PROPERTY THAT POSE RISK TO NEIGHBORS AND HOMES.  CAN THIS ISSUE BE ADDRESSED WITH THE OWNERS?  I HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED BY A NEIGHBOR THAT THE HOUSE IS ON THE CONDEMNATION LIST, BUT THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE TREES ON THE PROPERTY.   2.

SO, I AM WRITING TO YOU FOR HELP.   THE APARTMENT NEXT DOOR TO MY PROPERTY IS ABANDONED, AND SQUATTERS KEEP GETTING IN.  1795 BOULEVARD DE PROVINCE #C HAS OPEN WINDOWS, UNLOCKED DOORS, AND A FALLING DOWN FENCE IN THE BACK.  I CONTACTED THE OWNERS, WHO RECENTLY RECEIVED THE PROPERTY BY INHERITANCE TO LET THEM KNOW.  I AM NOT GETTING A RESPONSE. I CONTACTED THE VILLAGE DE PROVINCE HOA THROUGH LEWIS COMPANIES ABOUT IT, BUT IM NO LONGER GETTING A RESPONSE FROM THEM EITHER.  WHAT CAN BE DONE? I THINK THIS PROPERTY IS ATTRACTING BUGS, AND RODENTS, NOT TO MENTION VAGRANTS. THE VAGRANTS ARE CONTINUALLY BOTHERING MY RENTERS.  PLEASE ADVISE ME ABOUT NEXT STEPS, OR BETTER YET DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THIS PLACE SHOULD HAVE BOARDED UP WINDOWS, AND PADLOCKED DOORS. THE WAY IT IS NOW, IS INVITING TROUBLE.  I DID SPEAK TO THE OWNER OF THE OTHER NEXT DOOR APARTMENT, 1795 BOULEVARD DE PROVINCE #B. HE IS INTERESTED IN PURCHASING THE PROPERTY. THAT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT IS GOING ON IN THERE NOW.  THE PEOPLE ARE KNOWN DRUG USERS, AND WILL PROBABLY TAINT THE PROPERTY WITH METH LABS, ETC.  PLEASE HELLP US!  THANK YOU!   PS. I DID TRY TO FILE THIS ONLINE, BUT THE ONLINE PORTAL JUST KEPT LOOPING MY BACK TO THE INFORMATION PAGE. IT WOULD NOT GET ME TO THE FORM TO FILL OUT THIS REQUEST FOR SERVICE.

PROPERTY HAS BEEN ABANDONED SINCE THE OWNER (MAN) DIED A FEW YEARS AGO. THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR SAYS THAT THE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS (AUNT AND SISTER I THINK) ARE NOW THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTY, BUT HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING TO IT YET, EXCEPT REMOVING JUNK, OLD AUTOS AND BOARDING UP WINDOWS AND DOORS WITH PLYWOOD. THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR ALSO TOLD ME THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY A HOLE IN THE ROOF AS WELL. THE 2 OVERGROWN PECAN TREES IN THE BACK ON OUR PROPERTY LINE NEED TO BE TRIMMED BACK TO PREVENT THEM FROM DROPPING LIMBS, BRANCHES DURING NEXT UPCOMING STORM. WE ALREADY HAD A PECAN TREE FALL ON OUR GARAGE BACK IN 2012 DURING HURRICANE ISAAC. FORTUNATELY WE COULD WORK WITH THE OWNER NEXT DOOR TO US SINCE HE WAS AROUND ON THE PROPERTY. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH NO ONE AT THE ABANDONED HOUSE AT 134 BELLEVIEW, WE WILL HAVE NO WAY TO FILE A CLAIM IF DAMAGE DOES OCCUR. ALVIN JONES IS LISTED AT THE OWNER, HOWEVER, HE MAY BE ONE THAT IS DECEASED AND THE FILES WERE NOT UPDATED. THE HOUSE IS VALUED AS OF 2025 AT:$10,650, SO ITS OBVIOUSLY WAY UNDER MARKET VALUE AND HAS LOW, IF ANY INSURANCE. PLEASE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ASAP. I WILL KEEP TRYING TO GET THIS RESOLVED. HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WILL BE INTERESTED IN BUYING AND/OR FIXING UP THIS PROPERTY, AS MORE IN THE AREA ARE BEING DONE SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION.

I HAD TO CONTACT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DUE TO THE HOME NOT HAVING ANYONE LIVING IN IT- OR SO WE THOUGHT.   THE HOMEOWNER (LAND LORD) WAS CONTACTED AND WE LEARNED THAT HE HAS BEEN ALLOWING  HOMELESS PEOPLE TO STAY IN HIS HOME.  HE ALSO STATED THAT THE HOME DOES NOT HAVE RUNNING WATER.  THE HOME HAS A BROKEN FRONT DOOR AND THERES TRASH ALL OVER THE PROPERTY.  WHAT CAN THE CITY DO TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION? THIS MORNING, A CLOTHES WASHING STATION WAS SPOTTED IN THE YARD, WHICH LEADS ME TO WONDER WHERE THEY ARE STEALING THIS WATER FROM? BRPD WAS CALLED OUT TO THE RESIDENCE YESTERDAY AND ONE OF THE RESIDENTS WAS ARRESTED, HOWEVER THERE WASNT MUCH THEY COULD DO SINCE THESE PEOPLE WERE THERE WITH PERMISSION FROM THE HOMEOWNER.

IT HAS BEEN VACANT FOR THE PAST THREE YEAR AND THERE IS A VERY LARGE DEAD TREE IN THE BACKYARD OF THE PROPERTY THAT IS LOSING BRANCHES AND THREATENS MY PROPERTY. WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT MY HOME, I HAD BOFINGERS TO REMOVE THE LARGEST BRANCH THAT WAS A THREAT, BUT IN THE YEARS SINCE, THE TREES DEMISE CONTINUES TO MAKE IT A HAZARD AND THERE IS A LARGE BEEHIVE IN THE TREE WITH BEES SWARMING REGULARLY INTO MY YARD.  THE FAMILY THAT OWNS THE PROPERTY HAS COMPLETELY ABANDONED IT.  A NEIGHBOR HAS CUT THE GRASS FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS!  AFTER A STORM EVENT, AT SOME POINT FEMA CAME OUT AND PUT A BLUE TARP OVER THE ROOF, WHICH IM NOT SURE WHY BECAUSE THE ROOF WAS NEVER GOING TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THE HOUSE IS DELAPIDATED.  IN THE YEARS SINCE, THE TARP HAS COMPLETELY DETERIORATED FROM THE WEATHER.  NOW, THERE IS BLUE PLASTIC AND MIRCROPLASTIC THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD, PARTICULARLY IN MY YARD, WHICH I CANNOT GET RID OFF.   THE FAMILY ATTEMPTED TO SELL THE PROPERTY BY OWNER ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, BUT NO ONE WOULD MEET THEIR PRICE AND THERE ARE TITLE ISSUES.  I AM REQUESTING THAT THE CITY ENFORCE ITS HOUSING CODES TO MAKE THE FAMILY MEET ITS OBLIGATION AS PROPERTY OWNERS TO BETTER MAINTAIN THE PROPERTY, REMOVE THE TARP AND CUT DOWN THE TREE FOR THE SAFETY OF THOSE OF US WHO LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

TRASH CLEANUP – NEAR POPEYES DRIVE-THRU 	 OBSERVATION: 	A SIGNIFICANT PILE OF TRASH, DEBRIS, AND A DISCARDED TIRE ARE LOCATED NEAR THE RUSTED SIDE DOOR FACING THE POPEYES DRIVE-THRU.  O	ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS: 	ACCUMULATED TRASH ATTRACTS PESTS, RODENTS, AND INSECTS. 	STANDING WATER IN OR AROUND THE TIRE CAN PROMOTE MOSQUITO BREEDING AND FOSTER MOLD GROWTH—ESPECIALLY IF MOLD SPORES BECOME AIRBORNE, POSING RESPIRATORY HAZARDS.  O	SAFETY CONCERNS: 	THE TRASH CREATES SLIP, TRIP, AND POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARDS. 	THE UNSIGHTLY ACCUMULATION DETRACTS FROM THE OVERALL APPEARANCE OF THE AREA AND MAY LEAD TO FURTHER CODE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES IF NOT PROMPTLY ADDRESSED.  O	ACTION REQUESTED: 	IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF THE TRASH AND TIRE TO RESTORE THE AREA’S CLEANLINESS AND SAFETY.  2.	PRESSURE WASHING – EXTERIOR CAR WASH AND ROADSIDE FACING EXTERIOR WALLS  O	OBSERVATION: 	THE BLUE AND WHITE METAL CAR WASH WALLS, AS WELL AS THE WHITE WALL FACING THE ROAD, ARE HEAVILY SOILED AND IN NEED OF THOROUGH CLEANING.  O	ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS: 	DIRT AND GRIME BUILDUP TRAPS MOISTURE AGAINST THE SURFACES, ACCELERATING CORROSION AND FOSTERING MOLD OR MILDEW GROWTH—ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS WHEN SPORES BECOME AIRBORNE. 	 SAFETY CONCERNS: 	DIRTY WALLS CAN INADVERTENTLY ENCOURAGE CRIME AND LOITERING BY CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT APPEARS NEGLECTED. 	THE CURRENT STATE OF THE WALLS SIGNALS POOR MAINTENANCE AND COULD LEAD TO FURTHER CODE VIOLATIONS.  O	ACTION REQUESTED: 	PRESSURE WASH THE AFFECTED WALLS TO RESTORE THEIR APPEARANCE, ENHANCE SAFETY, AND PREVENT POTENTIAL CODE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: •	MULTIPLE LETTERS HAVE BEEN SENT PREVIOUSLY REGARDING THESE ISSUES. •	PHOTOS DOCUMENTING THESE CONDITIONS ARE ATTACHED.  •	COMMUNITY IMPACT: UNFORTUNATELY, IN THEIR CURRENT STATE, THE WALLS FACING THE ROAD DETRACT FROM THE OVERALL EFFORTS BEING MADE BY OTHER LOCAL BUSINESSES TO UPLIFT THE AREA.

THE UNSIGHTLY GARDENS ARE INSTALLED ON BATON ROUGE CITY PROPERTY AT EACH CROSS ROAD ON CAMELLIA STREET AND PARK BLVD, ADJACENT TO HOMES WITHOUT HOMEOWNER’S PERMISSION .  2.	THE GARDENS ARE NOT CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED FROM MARCH TO NOVEMBER & BECOME UNRULY.  3.	THE UNRULY GARDENS VISUALLY IMPAIR DRIVER’S VISION WHEN AT STOP SIGNS TRYING TO CROSS OVER CAMELLIA WHICH IS MAIN THOROUGHFARE IN THE GARDEN DISTRICT. 4.	OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS 2.5’ TO  3’ HIGH CONCRETE STATUES HAVE BEEN ADDED AND GLASS GLOBES FOR “DECORATION” ON EACH CORNER ALONG CAMELLIA STREET . THESE CONCRETE STATUES BLOCK FIRE HYDRANTS AND ARE A DANGER TO VEHICLES. IF A VEHICLE WERE TO ACCIDENTALLY SWERVE AND HIT A CONCRETE STATUE (THAT IS ON BR CITY PROPERTY) THE VEHICLE WOULD BE SEVERELY DAMAGED AND THE PASSENGERS IN THE CAR.  5.	DEBRIS AND DANGEROUS GARDEN TOOLS/BRICKS ARE REGULARLY LEFT ON THE SIDEWALKS CAUSING PEDESTRIANS IN WHEELCHAIRS TO HAVE TO GO ON THE STREET AND BACK UP ON THE SIDEWALK TO NAVIGATE AROUND THE SHARP TOOLS/ AND BRICKS. 6.	WHEN THE PLANTS ARE WATERED GINGER WILL DRIVE HER VEHICLE ALONG CAMELLIA FREQUENTLY STOPPING AT EACH CORNER CAUSING TRAFFIC ISSUES. MS FORD WILL EITHER HOOK HER HOSE UP TO A RESIDENTIAL WATER SPOUT (WITHOUT PERMISSION FROM THE HOMEOWNER) AND USE THE HOMEOWNER’S SERVICES. OR SHE WILL FERRY WATER FROM THE TRUNK OF HER VEHICLE TO THE PLANTS, REGULARLY  STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET CAUSING TRAFFIC ISSUES.  7.	LAST SPRING I PERSONALLY WITNESSED AN AMBULANCE TRYING TO GET TO A RESIDENT IN CRITICAL NEED. THE AMBULANCE HAD TO STOP, REVERSE AND DRIVE DOWN A DIFFERENT STREET TO GET TO THE PATIENT BECAUSE MS FORD’S CAR WAS BLOCKING CAMELLIA STREET WHILE SHE WAS INSTALLING PLANTS ON CITY PROPERTY.  LAST SPRING MS FORD STARTED EXPANDING HER “GARDENS” AND  STAKED DOWN LARGE BLUE TARPS ON THE MEDIAN ON PARK BLVD IN PREPARATION FOR CREATING THE SAME HAZARDOUS GARDENS AS ON CAMELLIA STREET.   PLEASE SEE PICTURES TO FOLLOW SHOWING SUNFLOWERS THAT HAVE GOTTEN SO TALL THAT MS FORD USES ROPE TO TIE THE PLANTS TO CITY STOP SIGNS SO THE PLANTS DO NOT FALL OVER.  ALSO INCLUDED IS A PICTIRE OF A 3’ TALL CONCRETE BIRD BATH BLOCKING A CITY FIRE HYDRANT.   GINGER FORD DOES NOT HAVE A PERMIT TO DO THIS. HOMEOWNERS DO NOT WANT MS GINGER TO CONTINUE THESE CARELESS ACTIONS AND WANT A STOP THESE HAZARDOUS UNSIGHTLY PLANT BEDS.  THEY ARE A PUBLIC NUISANCE.  THEY ARE DANGEROUS. THEY ARE ON CITY PROPERTY WITHOUT PERMISSION.  THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER 5 YEARS AND IS OUT OF HAND.  CAN YOU PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR THE WELLBEING OF OUR ELDERLY DISABLED RESIDENTS AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT LIVES IN THE AREA.   THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
